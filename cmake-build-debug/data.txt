The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of C and is still widely Unix read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first Unix edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.
